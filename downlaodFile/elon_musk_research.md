This document provides a comprehensive overview of Elon Musk's life, career trajectory, major achievements, controversies, and recent activities.

## Early Life & Family

### Childhood in South Africa


Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa, to Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, and Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Canada. Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.


Musk's childhood was marked by his early interest in technology and computing. At the age of 10, he taught himself computer programming, demonstrating the technical aptitude that would later define his career. By age 12, he had created and sold his first software, a space game called Blastar, for approximately $500.


His early years were not without challenges. Musk was severely bullied during his school years and has described his childhood as difficult. His parents divorced when he was young, and he lived primarily with his father, a relationship that Musk has since described as troubled.

### Education


Musk attended private schools in South Africa, including Waterkloof House Preparatory School and later Pretoria Boys High School. His academic interests were primarily in science and technology, though he was not always recognized as an exceptional student in traditional academic settings.


At age 17, Musk made a significant life decision to leave South Africa, partly to avoid mandatory military service during the apartheid era. He moved to Canada in 1989, where his mother had citizenship through her Canadian-born parents.

## Education

### Higher Education


After arriving in Canada, Musk attended Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario for two years. In 1992, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania in the United States, where he pursued a dual bachelor's degree.


At Penn, Musk earned two bachelor's degrees:

* Bachelor of Science in Physics from the College of Arts and Sciences

* Bachelor of Science in Economics from the Wharton School of Business


During his time at university, Musk and a classmate wrote a business plan for an electronic city guide for the newspaper industry, showing his early entrepreneurial mindset.

### Stanford University


In 1995, Musk was accepted into a Ph.D. program in applied physics and materials science at Stanford University in California. However, his timing coincided with the internet boom, and after just two days, he decided to leave the program to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities in the rapidly growing internet sector. This decision would prove pivotal in launching his business career.

## [X.com](http://X.com) & PayPal

### Zip2 Corporation


Musk's first major entrepreneurial venture was Zip2, which he founded in 1995 with his brother Kimbal and Greg Kouri. Zip2 was a web software company that developed and marketed an internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry. The company provided content for the new websites of both The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.


Initially, Musk and his brother lived in the office and showered at the YMCA to save money. Their perseverance paid off when Compaq acquired Zip2 for nearly $300 million in 1999. From this sale, Musk received $22 million for his 7% share, giving him the capital to pursue his next venture.

### [X.com](http://X.com) and PayPal


In March 1999, Musk co-founded [X.com](http://X.com), one of the world's first online banks. The company's innovative approach to online financial services attracted customers rapidly. In 2000, [X.com](http://X.com) merged with Confinity, a company founded by Peter Thiel and Max Levchin that had created a money transfer service called PayPal.


Initially, there was tension over whether to focus on [X.com](http://X.com)'s broader financial services or Confinity's PayPal service. Musk favored the [X.com](http://X.com) brand, but customer preference for PayPal led to the company focusing on that service. In 2001, the company was renamed PayPal, and Musk was replaced as CEO, though he remained on the board.


In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock. As PayPal's largest shareholder with 11.7% of shares, Musk received $165 million from the sale. This substantial windfall provided the funding for his subsequent ventures in space exploration and sustainable energy.
